    /**
     * Represents a postal address in a country. The address format is based
     * on an [open-source library from Google](https://github.com/google/libaddressinput). For more information,
     * see [AddressValidationMetadata](https://github.com/google/libaddressinput/wiki/AddressValidationMetadata).
     * This format has dedicated fields for four address components: postal code,
     * locality (city), administrative district (state, prefecture, or province), and
     * sublocality (town or village). These components have dedicated fields in the
     * `Address` object because software sometimes behaves differently based on them.
     * For example, sales tax software may charge different amounts of sales tax
     * based on the postal code, and some software is only available in
     * certain states due to compliance reasons.
     * For the remaining address components, the `Address` type provides the
     * `address_line_1` and `address_line_2` fields for free-form data entry.
     * These fields are free-form because the remaining address components have
     * too many variations around the world and typical software does not parse
     * these components. These fields enable users to enter anything they want.
     * Note that, in the current implementation, all other `Address` type fields are blank.
     * These include `address_line_3`, `sublocality_2`, `sublocality_3`,
     * `administrative_district_level_2`, `administrative_district_level_3`,
     * `first_name`, `last_name`, and `organization`.
     * When it comes to localization, the seller's language preferences
     * (see [Language preferences](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/locations-api#location-specific-and-seller-level-language-preferences))
     * are ignored for addresses. Even though Square products (such as Square Point of Sale
     * and the Seller Dashboard) mostly use a seller's language preference in
     * communication, when it comes to addresses, they will use English for a US address,
     * Japanese for an address in Japan, and so on.
