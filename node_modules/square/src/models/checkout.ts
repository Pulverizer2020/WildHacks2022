   * Represents a postal address in a country. The address format is based
   * on an [open-source library from Google](https://github.com/google/libaddressinput). For more information,
   * see [AddressValidationMetadata](https://github.com/google/libaddressinput/wiki/AddressValidationMetadata).
   * This format has dedicated fields for four address components: postal code,
   * locality (city), administrative district (state, prefecture, or province), and
   * sublocality (town or village). These components have dedicated fields in the
   * `Address` object because software sometimes behaves differently based on them.
   * For example, sales tax software may charge different amounts of sales tax
   * based on the postal code, and some software is only available in
   * certain states due to compliance reasons.
   * For the remaining address components, the `Address` type provides the
   * `address_line_1` and `address_line_2` fields for free-form data entry.
   * These fields are free-form because the remaining address components have
   * too many variations around the world and typical software does not parse
   * these components. These fields enable users to enter anything they want.
   * Note that, in the current implementation, all other `Address` type fields are blank.
   * These include `address_line_3`, `sublocality_2`, `sublocality_3`,
   * `administrative_district_level_2`, `administrative_district_level_3`,
   * `first_name`, `last_name`, and `organization`.
   * When it comes to localization, the seller's language preferences
   * (see [Language preferences](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/locations-api#location-specific-and-seller-level-language-preferences))
   * are ignored for addresses. Even though Square products (such as Square Point of Sale
   * and the Seller Dashboard) mostly use a seller's language preference in
   * communication, when it comes to addresses, they will use English for a US address,
   * Japanese for an address in Japan, and so on.
